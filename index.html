  <h2>Simple QR Code scanner bookmarklet</h2>
  <a id="bm" draggable="true">QR</a> &lt;-- Move this to your browsers bookmark bar
  <h3>Test area</h3>
  Here is a text box to check if it works. Click into the text box, then click the bookmarklet, to see if it works properly:
  <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 10em;"></textarea>
  <h3>The bookmark code</h3>
  The above "QR" link / the bookmarklet, contains the following code:
  <pre id="bmc">
// Wrapper for bookmarklet function
javascript:void((()=>{

  // Get the active / focussed element
  let focus = document.activeElement;

  // The website may embed another using an iframe, which may have the focus instead of the input field. Find the active input field in embedded iframes
  while(focus && focus.contentDocument)
    focus = focus.contentDocument.activeElement;

  // If no element has the focus, or it isn't a text input or textarea, return (do nothing else)
  if(!focus || ( !(focus instanceof HTMLInputElement &amp;&amp; focus.type=='text') && !(focus instanceof HTMLTextAreaElement) ) )
    return;

  // Open the qr code scanner webapp 
  const app = open("https://qr-s.s.abrecht.li/", null, "height=600,width=600,resizable");

  // Callback for messages from the qr code scanner webapp
  const ondata = ({source, data})=>{

    // Check that the message was really from the qr code scanner webapp.
    if(source === app){

      // If it wasn't about a scanned qr code, return (do nothing else)
      if(data.type !== 'qr-code')
        return;

      // Append the data from the qr-code to the end of the input or textarea which was active/focussed when the qr code scanner webapp was opened
      focus.value += data.detail;

    }else{ // If the message was not from the qr code scanner webapp
      // And if it's still open, return (do nothing else)
      if(!app.closed)
        return;
    }

    // Either we got a QR code, or the qr code scanner webapp is closed. No longer listen for events &amp; try to close the webapp.
    removeEventListener("message", ondata);
    app.close();
  };

  // Wait for messages
  addEventListener("message", ondata, false);

// End of wrapper for bookmarklet function
})());
  </pre>
<script>
document.getElementById("bm").href = encodeURI( // Set the "QR" link/bookmarklet above & make sure it's properly URL Encoded
  document.getElementById("bmc").innerText // Set it to the content of the code above
          .replace(/\/\/ .*|^ *|/g,'').split('\n').join('').replace(/ +/g,' ') // But remove comments, newlines and spaces first
);
</script>

  <h3>Security considerations</h3>
  The qr code scanner webapp can not access the website on which the bookmarklet was executed, because it is opened in a new window, with a different origin.
  The Bookmarklet code, however, can and does access the website it is executed on, for finding the input field to past into, and so on.
  You can verify what the bookmarklet does yourself, see the bookmarklet code above and it's explanation above. Feel free to verify that it's accurat,
  and that the code in the final bookmarklet indeed matches the above (minus the comments and spaces).
  The qr code scanner webapp sends the content of a detected qr code as a message back to the bookmarklet which opened it. I use a 3rd party project for
  scanning the qr codes in the qr code scanner webapp, and I haven't audited it's source a lot. If you use it to scan a swiss qr code or something similar,
  I recommend double checking the reported data is accurate, just in case. It's always good to double check things.

  <h3>Limitations</h3>
  This bookmarklet will not work for inputs in an embeded frame with a diferent origin from the parent frame, and it will not work if the webpage blocks popups or javascript: URIs using it's Content-Security-Policy.

  <h3>Credit</h3>
  This is mostly based on and uses the qr code scanner demo from <a href="https://github.com/nimiq/qr-scanner">https://github.com/nimiq/qr-scanner</a>. That js library in turn uses some other libraries too.
